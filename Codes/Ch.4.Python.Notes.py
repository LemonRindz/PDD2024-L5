#Ch. 4 Decision Structures and Boolean Logic

#Python's Relational Operators:
#1. > (Greater Than)
#2. < (Less Than)
#3. >= (Greater Than or Equal To)
#4. <= (Less Than or Equal To)
#5. == (Equal To)
#6. != (Not Equal To)

#The first line in an 'if' statemnt is the 'if clause',
#which begins with 'if', then a Boolean expression, then :.
#The next line is a block, all of which must be indented
#with the same number of spaces.
#EX1. if BooleanExpression:
#       statement
#       etc.

#Use the 'if-else' statement in Python to create a dual
#alternative decision structure. When this statement
#executes, the Boolean expression is tested. If true, the
#first block after the if clause is executed; If false,
#the second block after the else clause is executed.
#EX2. if BooleanExpression:
#       statement
#       etc.
#     else:
#       statement
#       etc.

#Relational operators can be used to compare strings.
